<p>I am using the jQuery library because I know it's popular and I want to learn it. When you click on my name at the top of the homepage, the name changes randomly from a few different selections. I have added this functionality to each of my main headings, check it out!</p>

<p>At the bottom of my main page, I have a load schedule button which uses AJAX to load my current schedule from a text file. In practice, I will be able to easily update the text file directly.</p>
