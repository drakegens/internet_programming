<title> Milestone 4 Annotations</title>

</head>
<body>

<p>I have connected a mysql database to my contact form, so the results of the submission are stored for my review. I have created a table with phpmyadmin called "contactresults" with the following fields: fname, lname, email, reason, comments. Also, when a user submits, they will see how many other people have tried to contact me. 
</p>

<p>The only security issues that might arise within my site hover around the contact form data submission. However, before the data is inserted into the database, it is first checked with regular expressions in php. Then, the data is inserted with the bindParam function being utilized. I have also removed the display errors function in my code so individuals who might try to intentionally input an incorrect contact form submission will see no specific error results. </p>

<p>Since this is the last milestone, I have fixed a few CSS related things to make it look better. (For instance, the visitor number is better displayed) I believe that I have built a decent resume site that I wouldn't mind posting publically and is easily scalable as I grow into a technical professional.</p>
