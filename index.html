<p>I plan on creating a resume website. Of course, I want to have a page for my professional website, as well as a page for some personal projects. I also want a "contact me" form, maybe connected to a spreadsheet or database that keeps track of who is contacting me via my website. I haven't fully thought all the features and i'm sure ideas will come as the semester progresses, as far as what I can do with javascript and php.
I understand that as a technical professional having a website is definitely a requirement and I want a website that will demonstrate my technical prowess and allow me to further my career.</p>
